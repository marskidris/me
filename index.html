      &ldquo;I am a senior at Lewis University majoring in Computer Science, so I am excited to get my Bachelor of Science this spring 2026.
      <s>I just got my first internship this summer as an Associate Developer Intern, so I'm excited to start that.</s>
        I finished my first internship with BCBS as an Associate Developer Intern this past summer 2025 and it was a great experience.
      In my free time I like to write LITRPG fantasy stories and <s>plan to publish my first book before the end of this summer so that's exciting.</s> I received a
      publishing/audiobook deal so that's a thing now. I'm currently working with an editor to polish the final draft before production!
      I have an older brother in the same field and a younger sister who is also pursuing her BA in Computer Science, so I guess we all enjoy computers.&rdquo;

    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
    <p>
      &#8220;Well, I want to learn how to be a more efficient programmer and how to better effectively work in a team.
      I understand communication is the key to success in most cases but understanding is understanding.
      Its only when you apply the understanding that I believe you fully learn what you are doing.
      I would also like to come out a stronger developer. One of my favorite classes that truly improved not just my mindset but
      actual skills involve doing projects in languages I was unfamiliar with. During this course I learned how syntaxes as nearly the same
       outside a few characteristics of that programming language. It really opened my eyes and brought down a lot of fear
       I didn't know I held onto.&#8221;
